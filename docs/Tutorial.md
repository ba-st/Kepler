## Tutorial

Lets use this simple simple model: a customer registration system. Omitting more details for now we will have a Customer and a CustomerSystem.

To build the CustomerSystem you should create a sublass of `System`.

```smalltalk
System subclass: CustomerSystem
	instanceVariables: ''
	package: 'AAA'
```
