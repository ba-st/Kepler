> *Name origin*: Astronomer [Annie Jump Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon). A cool surname from a celebrity in astronomy, since Cannon works best when combined with other BA-ST architecture projects, like [Stardust](https://github.com/ba-st/Stardust) and [Kepler](https://github.com/ba-st/Kepler).

With Cannon, we aim to provide a much needed state machine implementation, which is required for any complex workflow architecture.
